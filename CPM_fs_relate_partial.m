% Relates functional connectivity in each edge in connectivity matrix to 
% target variable, controlling for covariates, for CPM feature selection.
%
% INPUT: 
% train_vcts =          as described in CPM_cv_split.
% train_behav =         as described in CPM_cv_split.
% train_covars =        as described in CPM_cv_split.
% no_node =             as described in CPM_prep_arrays.
%
% OUTPUT:
% r_mat =               no_node * no_node array containing Pearson's r
%                       value for correlation of functional
%                       connectivity in each edge with target variable.
% p_mat =               no_node * no_node array containing p-value for
%                       Pearson's r correlation of functional
%                       connectivity in each edge with target variable.
